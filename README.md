# CloseTheGapCybersecurity

Close the Gap is an e-book project (currently not yet published) that is about turning theoretical programming knowledge into practical projects. In Close the Gap - Cybersecurity these projects will mainly be about security.

Planned topics are among others:

    WordPress Bruteforce (Bruteforce the WordPress Login Page)
    Email Harvester (find all email addresses on a specific site or collect as many as you want from the internet)
    Domain Phisher (check if someone is using a domain similar to yours for phishing)
    Virus Scanner (build a simple Virus Scanner by comparing file hashes with real malware hashes)
    Social Password (build your own rainbow Tables and wordlists from social media profiles)
    Further projects can be added, the final e-book should contain about 10 projects

Suggestions for further projects are welcome, these should be realizable in about 100-200 lines of code. Each project starts with a basic version that contains the absolute minimum functionality to show the feasibility of the solution. In 3 -4 further steps the basic solution is then improved and additional functionality is added. The E-Book will be available for free, who wants to participate in the project can contact me
